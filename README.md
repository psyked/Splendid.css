# Splendid.css

## Delightful defaults for humdrum HTML.

The default HTML elements are a little dull, and we shouldn't have to worry about adding custom css classes to the HTML or changing the markup to make things look beautiful.

Splendid.css is a set of styles for HTML elements, with *delightful details* baked in at the core, and requiring *minimal modification* to existing HTML so you don't need to go back to retrofit your HTML with a slew of new classes.
